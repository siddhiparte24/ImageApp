# ImageApp
This repository demonstrates how to perform image classification using Python and the ImageAI library. Image classification is a crucial task in computer vision where images are categorized into predefined classes or labels.

Features:
Library Used: Utilizes ImageAI, a versatile library for image recognition tasks.
Model: Implements MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network known for its speed and accuracy in image classification tasks.
Usage: The script loads a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and classifies an example image (cat.jpg) into multiple predicted labels along with their probabilities.
